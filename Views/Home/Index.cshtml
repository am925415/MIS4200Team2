        <p class="lead" style="color: orange;">
           Employees are awarded points through acting to enhance the company's core values. The managers and general employees can award each other points for
            specific tasks, but an employee is not able to give themselves points. Points will be reviewed by the system every week and at the end of the month 
            employees with a certain point total will be rewarded.
